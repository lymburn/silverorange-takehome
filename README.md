# Silverorange Native App Developer Take-home

## A few notes:

- A lot of functionality with playback logic and networking is in the view controller. I kept it simple for this exercise but would move much of it into a separate manager class for testability if I had more time (VideoServiceType is intended to be used for dependency injection).
- I didn't have time to make the playback buttons circular with a gray background and also kept the default white navigation bar. I'm not sure how exact to the wireframe it's supposed to be but I left those elements out.
- The playback buttons are always on screen as I didn't see anything mentioned about it.
- I didn't add any tests but intend to if given more time.
